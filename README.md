# 🐯 Whirl – LSU Campus Social App

Whirl is a mobile application built for **Louisiana State University (LSU)** students to meet new people, join student activities, and stay connected with campus life.

## ⚙️ Setup & Run (Development)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ghebert3/4330-Group-Project.git
cd 4330-Group-Project
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the App

```bash
npx expo start
```

Then:

- Scan the QR code with your phone using the **Expo Go** app, or
- Press **“Run on Android/iOS Emulator”** in the terminal to test locally.

### Troubleshooting

If Expo Go won’t load on your laptop:
Run npm install
Run npm install expo
Run npx expo install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage

make sure your tsconfig looks like 

{
  "extends": "expo/tsconfig.base",
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "jsx": "react-native",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true
  }
}

If still have  connectivity issues: 

Start Expo using:
Fully close Expo Go and npx expo start --tunnel

## 🔒 Authentication Logic

- Users can **sign up or log in** only with an `@lsu.edu` email.
- Supabase handles session tokens and automatic reauthentication.
- Once logged in, the app stores the session locally and redirects to the Home screen.
- If no session is found, users see the Login/SignUp screen.

## 💾 Database Schema (In Progress)

| Table      | Purpose                                            |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `profiles` | Basic user info (id, email, username, bio, avatar) |
| `posts`    | Feed posts (caption, image, author)                |
| `stories`  | 24-hour temporary stories                          |
| `swipes`   | Swipe left/right interactions                      |
| `matches`  | Mutual right swipes between users                  |
| `events`   | Campus meetups or club events                      |
| `reports`  | User safety and moderation logs                    |

> The schema and Row-Level Security (RLS) policies are managed directly in Supabase.
